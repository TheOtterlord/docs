[GitBook](https://gitbook.com) is a web-based platform for creating and publishing documentation and books in a collaborative manner, with version control integration and customizable features.


## Key Similarities between GitBook and Astro

GitBook and Astro share some similarities that will help you migrate your project:

- Both Astro and GitBook support [Markdown](/en/guides/markdown-content/). You can migrate all your existing documentation utilizing GitBook's gitsync feature.

- Both Astro and GitBook use some form of [file-based routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/). Using Astro's file structure for your existing content and when adding new pages should feel familiar.

## Key Differences between GitBook and Astro

When you migrate your GitBook docs to Astro, you will notice some important differences:

- A GitBook site is edited using an online dashboard. In Astro, you will use a [code editor](/en/editor-setup/) and development environment to maintain your site. You can develop locally on your machine, or choose a cloud editor/development environment like StackBlitz, CodeSandbox or Gitpod.

- GitBook stores your content in a database. In Astro, you will have individual files (typically Markdown or MDX) in your [project directory](/en/core-concepts/project-structure/) for each page's content. Or, you can choose to use a [CMS for your content](/en/guides/cms/), even your existing GitBook instance, and use Astro to fetch and present the data.

- GitBook sites use a specialised version of Markdoc (a superset of Markdown) for content. Astro also supports Markdoc via the optional [Markdoc integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) to use `.mdx` files in addition to standard Markdown files.


## Switch from GitBook to Astro

To convert a GitBook documentation site to Astro, start with our official docs theme starter template, or explore more community docs themes in our [theme showcase](https://astro.build/themes?search=&categories%5B%5D=docs).

You can pass a `--template` argument to the `create astro` command to start a new Astro project with one of our official starters. Or, you can [start a new project from any existing Astro repository on GitHub](/en/install/auto/#starter-templates).

Once you have a new Astro project, you can sync your existing GitBook content to your new Astro project. GitBook has a [gitsync feature](https://docs.gitbook.com/product-tour/git-sync) that will automatically sync your GitBook content to a GitHub/GitLab repository. To sync directly to the docs template's content collection, specify `src/content/docs/en` or `src/content/docs` as the project directory.

:::caution
When enabling git sync be sure to specify "**GitBook to GitHub**" as the priority. This will ensure that your GitBook content is synced to your GitHub repository. Otherwise, you will overwrite your existing GitBook content.

:::

After syncing the content to your repository and deleting the sync, you'll have a copy of your GitBook content in your repository. There are a few things to take into account before you can use this content in your Astro project:

- Gitbook uses a special syntax that differs from Markdoc where the `/` prefix denoting a closing tag is replaced with `end` for Gitbook files. In addition, some features of Gitbook rely on custom Markdoc components.
- Astro's [Markdoc integration](/en/guides/integrations-guide/markdoc/) requires that the file extension be `.mdoc`. This is to avoid conflicts with other Markdown extensions like `.mdx` and `.md`.
