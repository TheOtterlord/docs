Using a rehype plugin, you can identify links in your markdown files that point to external sites and modify them. This includes adding icons to the end of each link.

## Prerequisites
- A project using Markdown for content pages.

## Recipe

1. Install the `rehype-external-links` plugin.

    ```shell
    npm install rehype-external-links
    ```

2. Import the plugin into your `astro.config.mjs` file. Pass it to the `rehypePlugins` array, along with an options object. Add a content property and set its `type` to `text` if you want to add plain text to the end of the link, or `raw` to add HTML to the end of the link.

    ```ts
    // ...
    import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      markdown: {
        rehypePlugins: [
          [
            rehypeExternalLinks,
            {
              content: { type: 'text', value: ' ðŸ”—' }
            }
          ],
        ]
      },
    });
    ```
