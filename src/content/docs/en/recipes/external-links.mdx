Using a rehype plugin, you can identify links in your Markdown files that point to external sites and modify them. This example adds icons to the end of each external link, so that visitors will know they are leaving your site.

## Prerequisites
- An Astro project using Markdown for content pages.

## Recipe

1. Install the `rehype-external-links` plugin.

    ```shell
    npm install rehype-external-links
    ```

2. Import the plugin into your `astro.config.mjs` file. 

	Pass `rehypeExternalLinks` to the `rehypePlugins` array, along with an options object that includes a content property. Set this property's `type` to `text` if you want to add plain text to the end of the link. To add HTML to the end of the link instead, set the property `type` to	`raw`.

    ```ts
    // ...
    import rehypeExternalLinks from 'rehype-external-links';

    export default defineConfig({
      // ...
      markdown: {
        rehypePlugins: [
          [
            rehypeExternalLinks,
            {
              content: { type: 'text', value: ' ðŸ”—' }
            }
          ],
        ]
      },
    });
    ```
